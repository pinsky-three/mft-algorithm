## Critical Discoveries

### 1. Exit Signals are TOXIC in 1m Scalping
- **ANY exit signal** (EMA, RSI, MACD) showed 0% win rate
- **Pure ATR exits** achieved 42.1% win rate
- **Lesson**: Trust the ATR system, eliminate noise

### 2. Entry Filter Hierarchy
```
1. Triple EMA alignment (trend)
2. RSI > 60 (strong momentum) 
3. MACD bullish (trend strength)
4. Volume > 2.0x mean (liquidity)
5. 15m directional filter (multi-timeframe)
```

### 3. ATR-Based Risk Management
- **Take Profit**: 3.5x ATR (achievable)
- **Stop Loss**: 2.0x ATR (realistic for market noise)
- **Trailing**: 1.5x ATR (preserve profits)

### 4. Fee Impact Solution
- **Maker fees** (0.02%) vs Taker fees (0.04%)
- **31% performance improvement** with maker fees
- **Market stoploss** for faster execution

## Final Strategy Configuration

### Entry Conditions
```python
# Triple EMA trend
cond_ema = (ema_30 > ema_120 > ema_360)

# Strong momentum
cond_rsi = (rsi > 60)
cond_macd = (macd > macd_signal)

# Premium liquidity
cond_volume = (volume > rolling_mean_30 * 2.0)
cond_volume_roc = (volume.pct_change(5) > 0)

# Multi-timeframe alignment  
cond_15m = (ema_30_15m > ema_120_15m)
```

### Exit System
```python
# 100% ATR-based exits - NO exit signals
# Take Profit: 3.5x ATR
# Stop Loss: 2.0x ATR  
# Trailing: 1.5x ATR
# Emergency SL: -30% (rarely triggered)
```
